# Ruby Analyze, an IrDA protocol analyzer in Ruby

This is a small app I have created in order to analyze some (possibly) IrDA data
from an old palm IR keyboard I purchased awhile ago and am finally getting to 
hacking. 

The code probably wont be all that helpful for anyone else, but could perhaps be
adapted slightly to work with other projects and use cases.

# ENJOY!
